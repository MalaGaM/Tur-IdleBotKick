A script for kicking all idlers, or a specific user.
This is done from irc, usally by @ only.

Running this with !kick only (default trigger) will kick
everyone in the state of Idle. A verify time can be
specified so that it verifies that they are still idle.
You may also do !kick <username> and it will kick only
that user from site (no verify time).
